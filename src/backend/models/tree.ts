/**
 * @function serializeState - In the context of React, state is often used to store data that determines the behavior and appearance of a component. By serializing the state, we can preserve the component's data across page refreshes, server-side rendering, and other transitions. Additionally, by serializing the state and passing it to a child component, we can create a deep clone of the state, which allows the child component to manipulate the state without affecting the original component. This is useful in situations where we want to keep the state of the parent component immutable, but still allow child components to modify a copy of the state.
 * @param state - Object that contains the current state of the application or system that needs to be serialized.
 * @returns - Depclone of the passed in state. If there is any circulate state, return 'circularState'
